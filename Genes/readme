Files here look convenient, but the ortholog matchings are so strict as
to be useless.  E.g. sox11a has no orthologs, isl2b has only isl2b as
orthologs.  For our purposes, we want to consider sox11 and isl2 as
equivalent.

    Site says up to 6 orthologs, but consistently fails for 5
    Do a few at a time and paste together (non-trivial)
    Choosing "Compressed web file (notify by email)" helped but the
    link sent did not work 2 hours after receipt.  It did work the
    following morning.
